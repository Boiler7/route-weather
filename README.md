**Project name:**  Route and weather REST.

**Description:** The user indicates the location on the website (indicates GPS coordinates, the name of the institution, e.g. Å iauliai Academy, or the name of the street). When the button is pressed, the information is transferred to the cloud and another point/pin is marked on the map of the user's visited places.
